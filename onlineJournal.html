      <h2>How I got into it</h2>
      <div>
        <p>
          I got into Street Fighter when I was around 7 or 8 years old, when my father had got me this game called Street Fighter IV 
          for my PlayStation 3 at the time. I remember booting it up, 
          and being so enthralled by it. The first character I played was a character called
          Chun-Li because I remember seeing her in the fighting intro at the startup of the game, not knowing she was one of the hardest characters
          in the game in retrospect. Of course, I didn't care about execution or the things that I know now, now that I'm competitive.  
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Street Fighter</strong> is one of my favorite game series of all time. 
          I have played the 3rd game, the 4th, 5th, the crossover X Tekken, and the newest right now is the 6th game. I played so much after because I was enthralled with it, I got 
          some natural skill somewhat. I played the 4th game, 3rd strike, and then X Tekken. By X Tekken, I was decent.
        </p>

        <p>
          I keep it simple:
          pick one thing to practice (like anti-airs or a combo), grind it for a bit in ranked, then call it a day. That's what I did for most games after X Tekken.
          <br />
          I started to get good once I got to the fifth game by studying pro matches and trying to imitate them. Then it was a matter of exposure therapy, practice and I would even ask the pros for advice on how to get better.
          And I did get better. I was the 2nd best Laura player (a character in that game) in the world and now for the current game, I am one of the top manon and cammy players in the US.

        <p>
          <i>1. Don't tilt.</i> If ranked sessions or players get me tilted, you cannot play through tilt. You WILL play worse because you are emotional. Speaking from experience.
        </p>

        <p>
          <i>2. Keep it consistent.</i> Even 15 minutes counts. Especially on low-energy days.
        </p>

        <p>
          <i>3. Get comfortable with losing.</i> You would never become good if you didn't get your ass handed to you every now and then. You have to lose to WIN. Losing is the only way how to know how to win games.
